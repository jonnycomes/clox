## Climbing Nystrom's Mountain, Part III: clox

This is an interpreter for the lox programming language written in C. 

Almost all of the code in this repo is copied straight from Robert Nystrom's lovely book [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/). Indeed, typing out Nystrom's code (along with solutions to some of his Challenges) is how I am forcing myself to read the book carefully.
